Masking involves setting some of the pixel values in an image to zero, or some other "background" value. 
Masking can be done in one of two ways:-
1.Using an image as a mask. A mask image is simply an image where some of the pixel intensity values are zero, and others are non-zero. 
Wherever the pixel intensity value is zero in the mask image, then the pixel intensity of the resulting masked image will be set to the background value (normally zero).
2.Using a set of ROIs as the mask. The ROIs for each slice are used to define the mask.

Binary masks:-
Binary masks are used to change specific bits in the original value to the desired setting(s) or to create a specific output value. 
A binary mask is used to change one or more bits from 1 to 0 or vice versa using a boolean comparison operation.
